-- on demand; the order of execution of a sequence of such actions is thus
-- hard to predict since it is governed by the 'demand' and is interleaved
-- by executing the caller's code. For this reason, lazy IO is considered
-- 'unsafe'. When reading (and not writing), such a behavior is safe enough to
-- use lazy IO in the standard implementations of getContents, readFile, etc.

-- still finitely many actions; notice that newlines are "ignored"
-- until the actions in the left-hand side are complete
g4 = sequence (replicate 5 getChar ++ [undefined]) >>= putStrLn . takeWhile (/= '\n')

-- now, the actions in the right-hand side are performed lazily: we actually read a character
-- not earlier than we are ready to compare it with '\n' and put it to stdout.
-- That's why the characters are visibly doubled and newlines are taken into account immediately. 
g4' = (sequence . map unsafeInterleaveIO $ (replicate 5 getChar ++ [undefined])) >>= putStrLn . takeWhile (/= '\n')

g4'' = lazySequence (replicate 5 getChar ++ [undefined]) >>= putStrLn . takeWhile (/= '\n')

-- this behaves similarly to g4: we have ONE (sequenced) action which is performed 'later' than in g4,
-- but its steps are performed strictly one by one (without passing control to the right-hand side in between);
-- ineed, we have strict (>>=) INSIDE the implementation of sequence

-- here we have ONE action (for return) performed, which results in an infinite (lazy) list

-- prior to passing the resulting list any further.
