{-- The IO --}

{-- So far, every term (with its 'arguments' included)
-- has been 'pure', that is, its evaluation depends
-- solely on the term itself.
-- For example, 2 + 2 ALWAYS evaluates to 4 while
-- map (^2) [2..] evaluates to [4,9,16,25,...].

-- But often the evaluation of a program depends on
-- or changes something beyond this program scope.
-- For example, a program may 
-- (1) read from or write to a memory location; while
-- the location may be an argument of the program, the
-- value read is not directly specified but depends on
-- the memory state; likewise, the value written is not
-- what the program 'returns' (evaluates to).
-- (2) read from or write to some external 'IO stream';
-- (3) be influenced by hardware interrupts, signals,
-- user interaction, etc.  

-- In a word, the program may interact with the world 
-- out of its scope. Hence, it may produce DIFFERENT
-- computations depending on the state of that 'world'
-- with EFFECTS on the latter.

-- How can one DESCRIBE such phenomena in our declarative,
-- mathematics-like, equation-style programming laguage?

-- There exists a special formal machinery ('monads') for
-- this task. Now, let us focus on IO and consider it from
-- a practical angle.
--} 

-- Basically, we want to introduce some terms that represent
-- IO subroutines (such terms are known as (IO) 'actions').
-- At the lowest level, we shall have a set of 'black-box' terms
-- for elementary operations which are  provided by the system
-- (e.g., 'to read a character from stdin'). We want to be able to
-- combine such elementary operations into imperative style subroutines,
-- still being expressible as actions.

-- Let IO a be THE type for an IO action that 'returns' a
-- value of type a. If it returns nothing, we shall conventionally
-- use IO ().

-- In reality, IO a is a primitive implemented at the system level.
-- However, we can imagine (and formally descibe to some extent) it
-- to be like

-- type IO a = World -> (World, a) 

-- Indeed, an IO operation generally depends on the state of the World
-- and may change it, while returning some value of type a.

-- NOTICE: in fact, we are NOT going to supply any World argument to
-- a term of the type (IO a) since this "argument" is out of our scope.
-- However one can imagine such an argument provided automatically
-- during the run time, so that 'executing'
--      x <- act :: IO a
-- boils down to computing something like
--      (new_state_of_the_world, x) <- act current_state_of_the_world

a1 = getChar :: IO Char
-- read the current symbol from stdin; 'return' it;
-- change the World by making the next symbol in stding current.

-- What does getChar return? This depends on the state of the World,
-- and IS not a term in our program (every term is a 'constant').
-- So, we cannot test it this way:

-- test = (getChar == 'q') :: Bool

-- Notice that a1 is NOT the symbol returned but rather the
-- soubroutine "do read the current symbol!".

a2 = putChar :: Char -> IO ()
-- putChar 'q' is a subroutine to write the character 'q' into 
-- the current position in stdout and move to the next position;
-- the action putChar thus changes the world depending on the 
-- argument provided but returns nothing. 

-- We may combine these elementary actions into more involved
-- ones along the lines of imperative programming

-- read 3 chars but ignore the 2nd one
skip2nd :: IO (Char,Char)
skip2nd = do {x <- getChar; getChar; y <- getChar; return (x,y) }
-- x <- a mimics assingment of the value returned by the action a to
-- a local variable x, which may be an argument to further actions;
-- 'return' here is NOT what it might seem to be...

test_equal :: IO Bool
test_equal = do x <- getChar -- IO Char
                y <- getChar -- IO Char
